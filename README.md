# Time Tracker

Time Tracker is a regrouping of few scripts that will retrieve the log files of featured launchers, clean them a bit to let you see what game you played, when did you play it and how long.

As for now, it is very much an alpha and will require a lot of interpretation.
The data still needs some cleaning, manually and later, automatically, but should be usable for graphs.

It is also the first thing I ever wrote in any language.
